# About

Good thing you're curious. I'm zenqi, zen or anything you want to call me. I do alot of stuffs.<br>
I could say I'm more flexible with Python. Almost all of my projects were written in Python. <br>
I'm still a student and part time freelancer. I do freelancing services for discord by creating<br>
Bots, Websites and more. Backend is one of my main skills in web development. I'm not good at<br>
Front end stuff, lmao.
